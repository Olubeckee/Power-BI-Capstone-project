Tool(s) used: Microsoft Power BI

### Introductiion
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in the Nigeria is 
embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. 
Unfortunately, the media recently published in the news with the 
headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy” This doesn’t look 
good for the owners of the business based on their ambition to scale 
the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can 
only spiral downwards revealing other issues like gender pay gap 
amongst other possible issues.
The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma is keen to address these 
issues before it gets out of hands. The CHRO, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe has 
been assigned the task to identify key areas within the business that 
could spring up issues and address them immediately

## The Business Solution

### For this case study my final report in Power BI will make the  Management make their decisions by evaluating the following ;

1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to 
regions and departments

2. Show insights on ratings based on gender

3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a 
gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and 
regions that should be the focus of management

4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires 
manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of 
$90,000
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
- Show pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of 
$10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of 
$10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000 etc. Also visualize this 
by regions

5. Mr Gamma thought to himself that since you were already working 
on the employee data, you could help out with allocating the annual 
bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed 
another data to you that contains rules for making bonus payments 
and asked you to
- calculate the amount to be paid as bonus to individual 
employees
- Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees 
(salary inclusive of bonus)
- Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

## THE APPROACH
I followed this approach in modelling the solution above for the business challenge:
